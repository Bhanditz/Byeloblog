#Byeloblog

Byeloblog is a simple static site generator, in the vein of Tom Preston-Werner's [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

#What?

Byelobog was a fakeloric Jekyll to Chernobog's Hyde in modern reinterpretations of pre Christian Slavic mythology; Byeloblog as a neologism was too much for me to resist.

#No really, What?

This is a combination of simple libraries written in Ioke for templating and generating xhtml and css, with some good defaults for blogs.

#Installing

    git clone git://github.com/flaviusb/Byeloblog.git
